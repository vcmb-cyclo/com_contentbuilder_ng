## About the Project

This repository provides **community-maintained updates and fixes for ContentBuilder**,  
a Joomla extension originally developed by **Crosstec**. The original Crosstec project 
is no longer maintained or supported.

This ContentBuiler-ng (new gen) has been highly refactored for Joomla 6 native support.
New Gen releases releases will be named: " contentBuiler-ng-6.1.xx.zip " and above

This initiative aims to keep the extension usable on modern Joomla installations by:
- fixing compatibility issues
- removing deprecated APIs
- adapting the codebase to Joomla 5.x and 6.x
